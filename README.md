rules-of-software-development
=============================

A collection of rules extracted from several books and personal experiences for software development, this covers only soft skills and no technical things. And this covers my personl view of things.

# Golden rules

## Search for 'Smart creatives'

This term is from google. Meant are people which can not only write good code. Additionally they have at least a basic understanding for business needs, processes, the customer and everything what is needed to have create great products.
The technology changes quickly, the base concept will last.

## Keep you hierarchies flat

There should be a flat hierachy. For example google says a leader should have at least 7 person to lead in order to take sure that no micromanaging will happen.

## Maintain your culture

If you have values (and you probybly should have), than take sure that the people will follow them. Challange your decision against the culture/values. If you can not follow the values, then you do not have them.

## Move decisions to the persons who have the informations

If you try to let the a small group of persons take the important decisions for other people, all the information mut be transportet, translated (from IT terms to business terms for example). This will cost you a lot of time and the information will change by the translation and the context will be lost. So give people clear responsibilties and trust them to take the right decsision in this areas.

## Responsibilty means the right to decide and vice versa

If you give hand the responsibilty for a topic to a person but don't let the person take the decide, he will be demotivated or he will be at least not committed to the topic. The results will not be innovative and of a high quality. So do not split the responsibility from the right to decide.

## fire the antisocial elements, reward the uncomfortable

Good people are often self motivated. They hate rules, they do not agree to everything. They are difficult to handle. This is exhausting but will results in improvements and results which are not reachable by a group of follower.
But that does not mean that they are allowed to harm people, destroy the social structures, sell the work of other people as their own work. So these type of people you should fire.

## create a pot mortem culture

Failures will happen. It is crucial to learn from it. So speak clearly about mistakes, make clear that it is aloud to make mistakes and execute PostMortems without blaming.

## But awareness in your culture

Like in a soccer team, everybody should be aware of the crucial things which are happening. Even if the defender have different skills to the Attackers and even if they concentrate on defending they hav a clear view of all things which are happening on the field. Keep everything transparent and reward the people which show awareness and interest in the things which happen in the company.

# Interesting rules

## crowded working rooms but open spaces

Think about creating rest rooms, open spaces for you employees, but keep the working rooms crowded to ensure efficient communication and transparency.

## creating a yes culture

There are maybe some companies were someone should say no sometimes, but most of the companies are so afraid of making mistakes, that they block innovative ideas and demotivate people. So prefer doing something and learning from it instead of blocking it upfront. Fast failure is the key word.

## Dont be evil

Google has a 'Dont be evil rule'. If this is part of your culture, awareness, motivation and trust is more likely to happen.

## Dont change process until you have an understanding of how it works

Don't start doing scrum, kanban or something before you understand the idea of agility. Starting a maybe good but not fitting process will have very bad results.
